What is MLCAT?
==========================
Welcome to the Mailing List Community Analysis Tool! The main objective of this project is to develop a mailing list parser to extract information from a mailing list such as senders,receivers, time stamps etc and then use this to construct an organizational (or communication) structure like conversation thread hypergraphs for further analysis. We utilize social network analysis techniques to examine the relationships between authors on common mailing lists like LKML, Sakai, Apache etc. Study of these interactions on different levels helps us in deriving the local and global communication patterns between users on different threads.

In the field of social networking there exists a social structure which consists of various social actors (authors, groups or organisations) along with the interactions between these actors. The social network perspective provides a complete set of methods for analyzing the observed entities, dynamics and patterns in a social structure. It marks the emergence of the field of social network analysis which is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences.

This project draws its inspiration from various fields such as data mining, graph theory, information retrieval and inferential modelling in order to form predictive models that help in understanding certain intricate characteristics of a social network. This involves analyzing graphs with, say, authors as nodes and their correspondences as edges, to study the details about various network graph properties such as density, size, node centrality, degree, connectedness etc.
